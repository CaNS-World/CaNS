timing
------

This program can be used to benchmark the performance of the FFT library. 
Timings for both c2c and r2c/c2r transforms are collected. Also the FFT
library is validated as the input data should be recovered to machine
accuracy after a forward and a backward transform and proper normalisation.

To run: set a proper problem size and number of MPI processes to use (these
are hardware dependent).

What to expect:
- The timing results
- The error reported should be around machine accuracy (~ 10^-6 for single
  precision and 10^-15 for double)
