test2d
------

This program is to validate the 2D pencil decomposition library. It transposes
a set of data into different storage formats so that all communication routines
are tested. The test code also demonstrates to use of the I/O library.

To run: use 12 MPI processes.

What to expect: many files are written to disk. Regardless of the pencil-
orientation of the distributed data, files written collectively by all MPI
processes should contain identical information. For example, u1.dat, u2.dat,
u3.dat, u2b.dat and u1b.dat should be all identical.
