tecplot_view
------------

This program generates data to visualise the 2D decomposition options.

To run: use 12 MPI processes.

What to expect: several data files are written to disk. These are in the 
standard format that can be read by Tecplot (a visualisation package popular 
in the CFD community).

There is also an interactive web page at http://www.2decomp.org/decomp.php 
to demonstrate the data distribution in a 2D decomposition.
