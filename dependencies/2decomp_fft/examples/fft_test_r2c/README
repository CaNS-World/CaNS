fft_test_r2c
------------

This example demonstrates the use of the FFT r2c/c2r interface. It generates
random input and computes a serial 3D r2c transform on rank 0 to generate 
reference results. It then performs parallel computations of the same transform
on distributed data. There are two separate tests, with input data distributed 
in X-pencil and Z-pencil, respectively. In each test, a r2c transform is 
performed first and its results on rank 0 printed out. Then an inverse c2r 
transform is followed which should recover the input to machine accuracy.

To run: use 4 MPI processes.

What to expect:
- The output from the distributed computations should contain a subset of
  numbers as in the serial output.
- The error reported should be around machine accuracy (~ 10^-6 for single
  precision and 10^-15 for double)
