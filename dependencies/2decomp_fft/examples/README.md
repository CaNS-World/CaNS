========

* test2d       - to test the base 2D pencil decomposition module 

* fft_test_c2c - to test the complex-to-complex FFTs 

* fft_test_r2c - to test the real-to-complex/complex-to-real FFTs

* timing       - to benchmark the FFT library

* halo_test    - to test the halo-cell exchange code

* io_test      - to test various IO functions

* p3dfft       - to crosscheck the library against P3DFFT

* non_blocking - to test the idea of overlap communication and computation

* tecplot_view - to generate Tecplot visualisation of the decomposition


Some examples may require external libraries to be built first. Refer to the README files for each example for details.
