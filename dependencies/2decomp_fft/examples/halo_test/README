halo_test
---------

This example demonstrates the use of the halo-cell support API. It calculates
the divergency of an arbitrary field, which contains evaluation of spatial
derivatives in all three dimensions. The calculation was first implemented via
the global transposition routines, then via halo-cell exchanges. Identical
results are to be expected regardless of the communication algorithm. The 
computation is based on an explicit finite difference method so clearly using 
the halo-cell support API is more efficient.

To run: use 12 MPI processes.

What to expect: the output using different communication algorithms should be 
exactly the same.
