I would like to thank all the great feedback from those who have tried/used/studied CaNS.
My original intent was to write a useful and fast base Navier-Stokes solver for research,
but looking back it is clear that my expectations have been exceeded.
Also, your inputs have led to many important extensions, improvements, and bug fixes.

The list of people to thank is too large to place here, as I risk being being unfair
and missing names. If you feel you deserve a special token of appreciation, please
write and I am happy to send out a few Portuguese Pasteis de Nata.

I would like to acknowledge Wim-Paul Breugem and Bendiks Jan Boersma from the TU
Delft for fruitful discussions that motivated the development of this code.
Although written from scratch, this code was deeply influenced by an in-house
FORTRAN code for turbulent channel flow developed by WPB.

The routines for performing global transpositions are based on the 2decomp&fft
library (http://www.2decomp.org/decomp.html). Some modifications to these
routines have been performed in the CFD code AFiD
(https://github.com/PhysicsofFluids/AFiD), and ported to this code.

Moreover, the initialization of Multi-Threaded FFTs with the FFTW guru interface
was inspired by AFiD's implementation.
